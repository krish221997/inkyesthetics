                        This application allows young and upcoming musicians to Ô¨Årst choose their instrument from a list
                        of
                        options and then to understand notes of their own music as well as that of other artists and
                        shape
                        their tunes with precision to perfection. It is also a forum to share their craft, queries, and
                        learnings. Also, this would be an application where the artist can record a music piece if it is
                        an
                        original, then they can access the information about the song, the genre, tuning settings, as
                        well
                        as the chords that need to be played.</Text>
