        brief: "The local artisans in Kutch have been creating exceptional art for generations, but their work is appreciated only within the limits of their local communities. The objective of a collaboration is to address the communication barriers between the artisans and potential direct consumers. The challenge is to allow them to draw from their heritage while at the same time push their boundaries by enabling them to communicate the value & meaning of their work with wider consumer contexts.  \n" +

        brief: "Deconstruction, as this project treats it, is largely associated with the concept of unfolding, peeling back layers to examine how something has been created, has been constructed.
